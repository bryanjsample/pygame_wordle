# Pygame Wordle

>**Disclaimer:** This version of Wordle is based off of the `words` file located in /usr/share/dict/words on most UNIX operating systems. This means that there are acronyms included in the word bank, and many words that are not included in the English dictionary, but could potentially be recognized by an auto-completer. This version can be significantly harder than the NYT Wordle.
